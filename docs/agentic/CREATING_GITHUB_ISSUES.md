# Creating GitHub Issues for Documentation Implementation

This document provides instructions on how to create GitHub issues for the documentation implementation plan using the provided script.

## Prerequisites

1. **GitHub CLI (gh)**: Install the GitHub CLI tool
   - Installation instructions: https://cli.github.com/manual/installation
   - After installation, authenticate: `gh auth login`

2. **Repository Access**: Ensure you have write access to the repository

## Using the Script

### Step 1: Navigate to the Project Root

```bash
cd /path/to/agentic-code
```

### Step 2: Make the Script Executable

```bash
chmod +x scripts/create-github-issues.js
```

### Step 3: Run the Script

```bash
node scripts/create-github-issues.js
```

### Step 4: Verify Issues Created

The script will:
1. Parse the issues from `docs/agentic/GITHUB_ISSUES.md`
2. Create each issue in GitHub
3. Provide a summary of created issues

## Script Details

### What the Script Does

1. **Parses Issues**: Extracts issue details from the documentation file
2. **Creates Issues**: Uses GitHub CLI to create issues with proper metadata
3. **Handles Rate Limiting**: Adds delays between requests to avoid rate limiting
4. **Provides Summary**: Shows which issues were successfully created

### Issue Metadata

Each issue includes:
- **Title**: Clear, descriptive title
- **Labels**: Appropriate labels for categorization
- **Milestone**: Assigned to the correct milestone
- **Body**: Detailed description with tasks and acceptance criteria
- **Effort Estimate**: Time estimate for completion

### Error Handling

The script:
- Checks if GitHub CLI is installed
- Reports any issues that fail to create
- Continues creating remaining issues even if some fail
- Provides a summary of successful and failed attempts

## Manual Issue Creation

If you prefer to create issues manually, you can:

1. Go to the Issues tab in GitHub
2. Click "New issue"
3. Use the details from `docs/agentic/GITHUB_ISSUES.md`
4. Include appropriate labels and milestone

## Issue Organization

Issues are organized by phase:

### Phase 1: File Organization and Structure
- Create new documentation directory structure
- Rename and move documentation files
- Create README files for documentation directories
- Update internal links and references

### Phase 2: Documentation Integration
- Add navigation menus to documentation files
- Add cross-references between related documents
- Create consistent footer with links

### Phase 3: Documentation Generation and Automation
- Set up automated API documentation generation
- Create scripts for generating documentation metrics
- Implement automated documentation testing
- Set up documentation deployment automation
- Add documentation scripts to package.json

### Phase 4: Examples and Tutorials
- Create basic usage examples
- Create tool development examples
- Create provider development examples
- Create plugin development examples

### Phase 5: Documentation Maintenance
- Create documentation review process
- Set up documentation metrics
- Create documentation deployment scripts
- Finalize documentation structure

## Dependencies and Blocking

Issues have dependencies defined in their descriptions:
- Each issue lists which issues must be completed first
- This ensures proper order of implementation
- GitHub's issue tracking can be used to manage these dependencies

## Milestones

Issues are assigned to milestones based on the implementation timeline:
- **Documentation Implementation - Week 1**: Phase 1 issues
- **Documentation Implementation - Week 2**: Phase 2 issues
- **Documentation Implementation - Week 3**: Phase 3 issues
- **Documentation Implementation - Week 4**: Phase 4 issues
- **Documentation Implementation - Week 5**: Phase 5 issues

## Tracking Progress

To track implementation progress:

1. Use GitHub's project boards or milestones
2. Update issue status as work progresses
3. Close issues when completed
4. Use the effort estimates to track time spent

## Customization

If you need to customize the issues:

1. Edit `docs/agentic/GITHUB_ISSUES.md` directly
2. Modify issue titles, descriptions, labels, or milestones
3. Re-run the script to create updated issues
4. Delete and recreate issues if needed

## Troubleshooting

### GitHub CLI Not Found

If you get an error about GitHub CLI not being found:
1. Install GitHub CLI: https://cli.github.com/manual/installation
2. Authenticate: `gh auth login`
3. Try running the script again

### Authentication Issues

If you get authentication errors:
1. Run `gh auth login` to re-authenticate
2. Ensure you have write access to the repository
3. Check your GitHub permissions

### Rate Limiting

If you get rate limiting errors:
1. The script includes delays to avoid this
2. Wait a few minutes and try again
3. Create issues in smaller batches

### Issue Creation Failures

If some issues fail to create:
1. Check the error messages in the script output
2. Verify the issue content is valid
3. Create failed issues manually if needed

## Conclusion

This script provides an efficient way to create all the necessary GitHub issues for implementing the documentation plan. By following these instructions, you can quickly set up a comprehensive issue tracking system for the documentation implementation project.
