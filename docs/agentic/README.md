# Agentic Code - Core Concepts

Welcome to the Agentic Code core documentation. This directory contains foundational concepts and guidelines for understanding and working with the Agentic Code system.

## Overview

Agentic Code is an AI-powered coding agent that operates in the digital world, adapted from the [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli) with optimizations for [Qwen3-Coder models](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen3-Coder). This directory contains core documentation about the system's architecture, constitution, and workflow.

## Available Documentation

- [Architecture](./architecture.md) - Detailed architecture of the Agentic Code system
- [Constitution](./constitution.md) - Core principles and values that guide Agentic Code behavior
- [Workflow](./workflow.md) - How Agentic Code processes tasks and executes work
- [Vision](./vision.md) - Long-term vision and goals for Agentic Code
