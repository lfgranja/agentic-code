# Agentic Code - Core Concepts

Welcome to the Agentic Code core documentation. This directory contains foundational concepts and guidelines for understanding and working with the Agentic Code system.

## Overview

Agentic Code is an AI-powered coding agent that operates in the digital world, adapted from the [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli) with optimizations for [Qwen3-Coder models](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen3-Coder). This directory contains core documentation about the system's architecture, constitution, and workflow.
