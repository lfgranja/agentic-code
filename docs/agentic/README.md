# Agentic Code - Core Concepts

Welcome to the Agentic Code core documentation. This directory contains foundational concepts and guidelines for understanding and working with the Agentic Code system.

## Overview

Agentic Code is an AI-powered coding agent that operates in the digital world, adapted from the [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli) with optimizations for [Qwen3-Coder models](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen3-Coder). This directory contains core documentation about the system's architecture, constitution, and workflow.

## Available Documentation

- [Architecture](./architecture.md) - Detailed architecture of the Agentic Code system
- [Constitution](./constitution.md) - Core principles and values that guide Agentic Code behavior
- [Workflow](./workflow.md) - How Agentic Code processes tasks and executes work
- [Vision](./vision.md) - Long-term vision and goals for Agentic Code
- [GitHub Issue Guidelines](./GITHUB_ISSUES.md) - Guidelines for creating and managing issues
- [GitHub Issues](./GITHUB_ISSUES.md) - Understanding GitHub issue management in Agentic Code
- [Documentation Implementation Plan](./DOCUMENTATION_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md) - Planning document for documentation efforts

## Getting Started

If you're new to Agentic Code, we recommend starting with the [Constitution](./constitution.md) and [Workflow](./workflow.md) documents to understand the fundamental principles and processes that guide the system.
