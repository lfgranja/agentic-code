# Project Vision and Strategy: Agentic-code

## 1. Executive Summary

The "Agentic-code" project aims to create a state-of-the-art command-line interface (CLI) tool for AI-assisted software development. This tool unifies the best features of existing CLIs, building upon the solid foundation of Qwen Code and incorporating architectural elements from other tools. The key differentiator of Agentic-code will be its ability to operate under strict software engineering guidelines, ensuring that the AI not only generates code but does so consistently, qualitatively, and in alignment with best development practices.

## 2. Rationale and Vision

Current AI coding tools are extremely powerful but operate largely without constraints. They can generate code that, while functional, may not adhere to specific project's style guides, architecture patterns, quality standards, or documentation requirements. This creates significant friction where time gained in code generation is lost in refactoring and adaptation.

The vision of Agentic-code is to solve this problem by creating an "opinionated" AI assistant. An agent that is not just a task executor but a team member that rigorously follows defined rules and processes, acting as a guardian of code quality and consistency.

## 3. Starting Point and Base Architecture

The most important strategic decision is the choice of codebase foundation. After evaluation, the decision is to build upon the existing Qwen Code project.

### Reason for this Choice:
Qwen Code demonstrates superior software engineering implementation and better performance compared to alternatives. The project already has:
- A robust MCP (Model Context Protocol) client architecture for multi-provider support
- Comprehensive tool system with file operations, shell commands, and web capabilities
- Advanced IDE integration through the VSCode companion extension
- Strong authentication mechanisms including OAuth 2.0
- Well-structured codebase with clear separation between CLI and core packages

## 4. Current Architecture Strengths

### Multi-Provider Architecture
The existing MCP client architecture in `packages/core/src/tools/mcp-client.ts` already provides:
- Support for multiple transport types (HTTP, SSE, Stdio)
- OAuth authentication handling
- Tool discovery and registration system
- Dynamic provider switching capabilities

### Comprehensive Tool System
The tool system in `packages/core/src/tools/` offers:
- File operations (read, write, edit, search)
- Shell command execution
- Web fetching and search capabilities
- Memory management
- Task automation
- IDE integration for diff viewing and editing

### IDE Integration
The IDE client in `packages/core/src/ide/ide-client.ts` provides:
- Real-time file synchronization
- Diff viewing and editing
- Context-aware operations
- Multi-IDE support (primarily VS Code)

## 5. Strategic Enhancement Areas

### 5.1 Enhanced Code Quality Framework
While Qwen Code already has excellent tooling, we'll enhance it with:
- Stricter code style enforcement
- Architecture pattern validation
- Automated code review integration
- Documentation quality checks

### 5.2 Advanced Workflow Automation
Building on the existing tool system, we'll add:
- Pull request automation
- Issue management
- Continuous integration workflow support
- Automated testing generation

### 5.3 Enhanced MCP Integration
The current MCP implementation is solid but can be enhanced with:
- Better error handling and recovery
- More sophisticated provider management
- Enhanced security features
- Performance optimizations

## 6. The Governance: Integrating "Brain" and "Constitution"

### 6.1 The Role of Development Guidelines
The project will implement a comprehensive set of development guidelines that serve as the "constitution" for the AI agent. These guidelines will include:
- Code style and formatting standards
- Architecture patterns and principles
- Testing requirements and practices
- Documentation standards
- Security best practices

### 6.2 The Role of the Core System
The core system (`packages/core/src/core/client.ts`) will function as the orchestrating "brain." Its responsibilities will include:
- Loading relevant context for each task
- Injecting guidelines into prompts
- Enforcing compliance with established standards
- Providing feedback on code quality and adherence to guidelines

## 7. Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundation Enhancement
- Strengthen the existing MCP architecture
- Enhance tool system reliability and performance
- Improve IDE integration features
- Add comprehensive error handling

### Phase 2: Quality Framework Implementation
- Implement code quality validation system
- Add automated style checking
- Create architecture validation tools
- Implement documentation quality checks

### Phase 3: Workflow Automation
- Develop advanced workflow automation tools
- Create pull request and issue management systems
- Implement CI/CD integration features
- Add automated testing generation

### Phase 4: Advanced Features
- Implement plugin architecture for extended capabilities
- Add advanced analytics and reporting
- Create team collaboration features
- Implement advanced security features

## 8. Conclusion and Next Steps

The Agentic-code project represents a significant evolution in AI-assisted development tools. By building upon the solid engineering foundation of Qwen Code and enhancing it with stricter quality enforcement and workflow automation, we'll create a tool that not only generates code but ensures it meets the highest standards of software engineering.

The development will proceed with careful attention to maintaining backward compatibility while adding new features that enhance code quality, developer productivity, and team collaboration.

*This architecture ensures that Agentic-code will not only be a powerful AI assistant but also a guardian of code quality and consistency throughout the development process.*
