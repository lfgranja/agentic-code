# Token Caching and Cost Optimization

Qwen Code automatically optimizes API costs through token caching when using API key authentication (e.g., OpenAI-compatible providers). This feature reuses previous system instructions and context to reduce the number of tokens processed in subsequent requests.

**Token caching is available for:**

- API key users (Qwen API key)
- Vertex AI users (with project and location setup)

**Token caching is not available for:**

- OAuth users (Google Personal/Enterprise accounts) - the Code Assist API does not support cached content creation at this time

You can view your token usage and cached token savings using the `/stats` command. When cached tokens are available, they will be displayed in the stats output.
