# Qwen Code CLI

Within Qwen Code, `packages/cli` is the frontend for users to send and receive prompts with Qwen and other AI models and their associated tools. For a general overview of Qwen Code, see the [main documentation page](../index.md).

## Non-interactive mode

Qwen Code can be run in a non-interactive mode, which is useful for scripting and automation. In this mode, you pipe input to the CLI, it executes the command, and then it exits.

The following example pipes a command to Qwen Code from your terminal:

```bash
echo "What is fine tuning?" | qwen
```

Qwen Code executes the command and prints the output to your terminal. Note that you can achieve the same behavior by using the `--prompt` or `-p` flag. For example:

```bash
qwen -p "What is fine tuning?"
```
